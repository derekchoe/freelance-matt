               I’m Matt, a product designer from San Francisco. I specialize in
               user experience, interaction, and mobile design. Most recently, I
               was as a product designer at{" "}
               <span className='about__action'>Action Network</span> in San
               Francisco, working on the future of sports betting. Right now I
               am looking for something new. My interests are in consumer
               products, and helping to solve the needs of people and industries
               that fall behind as technology advances.

               In free time you will find me hacking away at a side project, and
               staying active within the design community. If you would like to

               ! I have a deep interest in becoming a creative coder - Any tips?

               When I’m not working on designing software, I enjoy spending time
               with my family and friends. I’ve been a fan of the San Francisco
               Giants and 49ers since I was born, so you will always catch me
               watching games. I also like to go golfing, check out museums,
               study early American history, and travel the world.
